This is the github account for the R package WeedEco. Here you will find the developmental R package code which will be updated when improvements are made. Please make sure you are using the most recent version.

If you have a question regarding the package and its use, please contact us via the discussion page.

The readme document within the WeedEco repository provides introductory instructions on how to use and cite the package.

More details regarding the use of the WeedEco package are provided in a Vegetation History and Archaeobotany journal article. Full details will be provided when it is published.

WeedEco has a sister package called CropPro which uses weed seed attributes to compare archaeobotanical assemablages against ethnographic crop processing sequences. CropPro can be found at https://github.com/CropPro-package
